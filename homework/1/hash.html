                <p> Hash Tables are a unique kind of combination of search and data structure. Hash tables consist of key/value pairs, with the keys being used to look up their corresponding values.</p>
                <p> The algorithm does this by <strong>hashing</strong> the key to return a <strong>hash value</strong>. <strong>Hashing</strong> is a process which takes in any string input, and outputs a long string of specified length.</p>
                <p> This string is repeatable, but not reversable, and is also <strong>not guaranteed to be unique</strong> to each key.</p>
                <p> The table hashes each new key and uses the hash value to assign the corresponding value an index.</p>
                <p> Because the hashes are likely, but <strong>not guaranteed</strong> to be unique, the table must have some way to deal with two keys hashing to the same value (called a <strong>hash collision</strong>.</p>
                <p> Hash tables are fast relative to other search options, with the search time remaining constant regardless of the number of items the algorithm has to search through.</p>

            <p>Hash lookup must have a way to deal with potential hash collisions (one bucket containing the values of two different keys).</p>
